# Intro-to-R Workshop
## Marine Semester 2023

Welcome to the Intro-to-R Workshop repository. The materials here-in are based on the [R-ecology-lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html) from datacarpentry.org. Before beginning workshop exercises, learners will need to have R and R-studio installed on their machine. Those are given in the following document:

[Pre-Workshop Handout](https://github.com/BUMP-In-Silica/Marine-Semester_Intro-to-R/blob/main/Pre-Workshop-Handout.md)

Once R and R-studio are working, learners should proceed to the Workshop Exercise:
