# Context

In the main Workshop Exercise you are asked to do data entry using Google Sheets, then export to a "csv" file which encodes tabular data in plain text. This additional handout gives step-by-step instructions with screen shot illustrations for those less familiar with Google Sheets.

## Step 1

Begin by navigating to [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/) and creating a blank Google Sheets document.
